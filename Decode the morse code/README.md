https://www.codewars.com/kata/54b724efac3d5402db00065e

Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

For example:

MorseCodeDecoder.Decode(".... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .")
//should return "HEY JUDE"
NOTE: For coding purposes you have to use ASCII characters . and -, not Unicode characters.

The Morse code table is preloaded for you as a dictionary, feel free to use it
